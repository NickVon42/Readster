# Readster (still in development)

A minimal reading tracker app that aims to keap the bloat out and focus on what matters: your reading habit. Keep a virtual library of all your favourite books to sort through and update your reading progress as you go. Readster will do the rest, and its best not to grab your attention for too long so you have more time to read.
